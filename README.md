# About me 


**Habio/Habio** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently studying at the University of Tasmania (UTAS)
- 🌱 I am currently developing my skills in stochastic modelling and artificial intelligence.
- 👯 I’m actively seeking academic positions, including lecturer and postdoctoral roles.
